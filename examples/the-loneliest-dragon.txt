The title of this adventure is The Loneliest Dragon.

You start with:
- A sword
- A pouch of gold
- A cucumber sandwich

Page 1:
You wake up in your small house at the south of the village to the sound of a rooster crowing. You yawn, stretch and make your way into your little kitchen.

What to have for breakfast?

To quickly gobble yesterday's cucumber sandwich and get on with your day, go to page 5.

To take your time and make a hearty meal of sausages, potatoes, beans and juice, go to page 20.

Page 5:
Your nose smells adventure! Keen to track it down, whatever it may be, you shove the slighty limp sandwich into your mouth and stride out the door, still chewing.

Go to page 8.

Page 8:
The big village bell is clanging, signalling all adventurers to congregate at the hall.

To head to the hall, go to page 37.

To get a head start on the other adventurers by sneaking out of the village, go to page 16.

Page 20:
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and you give it the attention it deserves.

Halfway through eating, the village librarian knocks on your door.

"I've got those books on dragons you were asking for. Pretty hot stuff!"

You pop the books in your backpack, thank the librarian and finish your breakfast. Feeling pleasantly full and ready for anything, you stroll out your door and into the village.
